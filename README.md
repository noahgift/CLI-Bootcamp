## Part 2-Build CLI in Python

* [python-click-cli-cookbook](https://github.com/noahgift/python-click-cli-cookbook)

## Challenges

### Bash and ZSH Challenges
* Customize your `~/.bashrc` with at least one alias, function and variable.
* Build a Bash CLI tool that takes options
* Truncate a large file and randomly sample at the same time
* Write a find command and a locate command
* Install [ohmzsh](https://ohmyz.sh), what did you learn?

### Python Challenges
* Pick a Python command-line tool library you are not familar with and build a module with a function that is called in a CLI.  A few examples:  
  * [python-fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire), 
  * [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
  * [python-click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/)
* Write a test for your python CLI tool
* Containerize your Python CLI tool and deploy to a public container repo like Github or Docker.  Here is an [example project](https://github.com/noahgift/container-from-scratch-python).

### Advanced Challenges

* Write a CLI in a language you don't know:

  * [cli-rosetta](https://github.com/noahgift/cli-rosetta)
  * [Bash, Powershell and C# CLI](https://github.com/noahgift/DotNet-AWS/tree/main/chapters/chap1)
